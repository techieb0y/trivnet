<p>You start at the login screen. Enter your call sign into the first box;
when you tab or click into the tactical call box, it should show the
name that matches the callsign from the FCC database. You can also pick
a symbol to go with the tactical call. Then click Login.</p>

<p>This takes you to the Home screen. Along the top and bottom are the menu
of other screens; below that is the short broadcast message display. In
the middle are the progress bars, message summaries, and some version info.</p>

<ul>
<li> Overall race progress bar - ratio of people with a 'Runner crossed
finish line' status to the total number of runners in the DB.
<li> Per-race start and finish points (new for this year) - a manually
updatable graphic representation of the lead runner and tail/chase car
positions for each race (10M/Marathon/Wheelchair).
<li> Status summary: counts of runners in each of the pre-defined status
conditions (Running, Crossed Finish Line, In Med Tent, Left Med Tent,
EMS Transport, Dropped out).
<li> Listing of free-form messages (and counts of how many times each have
been used)
<li> Listing of runners currently in the In Med Tent status.
</ul>

<p>The next tab is Search. You can perform a lookup based on bib number or
partial name. Clicking a name from the search results brings up the
detail page, which shows their data and lets you update it (along the
top), add a free-form message (or pick from some canned ones) along the
bottom, and their history is shown in the middle (including who and when
others have viewed this record). There's also a link to open the MTEC
Results page for the matching bib number (in a new tab) from here. If
you're changing multiple things, do them in two steps -- the Save and
Reset along the top apply only to runner data fields (Status), and the
Submit on the bottom only applies to the free-form entry box or canned
message drop-down beside it.</p>

<p>The next tab along the top is Multi-Edit; most of the data entry from
the three net controls along the course happens here. You get 3 boxes:
Box 1 lets you enter a bib number, box two pulls up the runners name so
you can confirm you didn't make a typo (if you have data to compare to).
Box 3 lets you enter a free-form text message. Once you tab out after
entering the message, a Save button will apear, and a new blank row is
started. Click the save button to actually commit the message to the
database.</p>

<p>Tab #5 is Batch Edit. Here you can type in a list of data (generally bib
numbers), or upload a text file containing the same (one per line), and
set them all to the same Status and Message (or bulk-edit other fields,
but that's generally less useful.) This is less directly useful to those
along the course, but is how we upload the data from the chip-timing
people with lists of finishers.</p>

<p>Tab #6 is the large broadcast message display screen. It shows a longer
view of the same message list from the top of the other tabs, and lets
you send messages either to a specific callsign, or to everyone. Message
lines are shown in alternating white and gray backgrounds, unless it's a
message specifically to your callsign; those are highlighted in yellow.</p>

<p>Tab #7 is the Admin tab. It has sub-tabs for editing data type fields
(and their selectable values), changing the canned free-form messages,
loading the database of runner names/bib numbers, and updating the race
lead-runner and tail position pointers.</p>
